<!--
Note: even if this package is configured to use a GitHub repo name
of the form PACKAGE (and *not* PACKAGE.jl), we still use the form
PACKAGE.jl for the main title of the README.
It is recommended to keep this convention as this is what users may
google for... (likewise for the sitename of the documentation)

<!--
Some note to clean-up
* The Badge Doc:Stable will link to 404 until you have published at last one release (right column)
* The Badge Doc:Dev link to 404 until you have run it MANUALLY
    * Todo add comments in Documenter.yml to enable on main commit (but explain that it cost minutes...)
    * In the doc setup, provite link to e.g. https://github.com/ylvain/Pk2.jl/actions/workflows/Documenter.yml
    * Run the doc manully to check deployment...
    * Explain that once deployed, the doc still need to be published by GitHub to the github.io site (wait or go see in the https://github.com/ylvain/PkDoc/deployments if it is publised)
* The Tests and Coverage run for each commit on `main`, for each pull request to `main` and can also be run manually
* The documentation has "Edit on GitHub" that links to https://github.com/ylvain/Pk2.jl/blob/master/docs/src/index.md#. master is not the correct branch... Links works but only because GitHub redirect to main
* Add some lines of codes in /src and some testset in /runtests, allows to check better doc and coverage
* If deploy doc to SAME repo, but as section telling how to enable GitPages on gh-pages (only after first run of documentation otherwise the bransh gh-pages is not yet created)
